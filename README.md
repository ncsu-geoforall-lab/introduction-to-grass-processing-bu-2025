# Introduction to GRASS GIS Processing Engine (Boston University 2025)

This is a set of Jupyter Notebooks for workshop for Boston University.

## How to run the notebooks

The workshop can be run online in [MyBinder](https://mybinder.org/) and [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com). This is a convenient way, since no installation is needed.

### MyBinder

### Google Colab

In Colab:
1. Download [prepared notebook](colab_notebook.ipynb)
2. Open [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com)
3. File -> Upload notebook
4. Upload downloaded notebook

In Google Colab we don't have pre-installed the software needed, so go ahead and execute the first cell to install it. Also, in order to avoid repeating the installation, we merged all notebooks into one.
